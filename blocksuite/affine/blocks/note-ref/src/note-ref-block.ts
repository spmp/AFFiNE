 *
 * SAME-DOC (`refDocId` unset or equal to the current doc, Story 0.6):
 * the *thinnest possible* mechanism — `BlockComponent` (the base class
 * every block, including `affine-note`'s own, extends) picks up `std`/
 * `store` via Lit's `@consume({context})`, resolved from whichever
 * `EditorHost` is its nearest DOM ancestor, not from however it got added
 * to that DOM. So rendering the canonical note's children here, through
 * `this.std.host.renderChildren(canonical)`, uses the exact same std,
 * store, dispatcher, selection/range manager, and keymaps as any other
 * block on the page — no nested `BlockStdScope`, no second `Store`, no
 * synchronization to ever get out of sync, because there is only ever one
 * of each.
 *
 * CROSS-DOC (`refDocId` genuinely different, Story 0.5): the same-doc
 * mechanism above cannot work here — `BlockComponent.model`/`.store`
 * (the base every rendered block relies on, all the way down) resolve via
 * the *ambient* `std.store`, the one shared store for the *current* doc.
 * A cross-doc canonical's children simply don't exist in that store at
 * all, so every child would silently fail to resolve its own model the
 * moment it mounts (confirmed live: `Cannot find block model for id N`,
 * thrown from deep inside `paragraph-block.ts`'s own `connectedCallback`,
 * for every single child). This mounts a genuinely separate nested
 * `BlockStdScope` bound to a `Query`-filtered `Store` for the *foreign*
 * doc instead — exactly `database-ref`'s own proven cross-doc mechanism
 * (`database-ref-block.ts`), adapted for Note. This reintroduces a second,
 * independent dispatcher/selection/view-registry — the same tradeoff
 * `database-ref`/`surface-ref` already carry for their own cross-doc
 * cases — which is why the same-doc path above deliberately avoids it
 * whenever it doesn't have to.

   * focus is lost: the user has to click back into the reference to keep
   * typing, on every single such command.
   *
   * Root cause, established across several rounds of live debugging (see
   * this story's own Change Log for the full trail — earlier fixes here
   * each looked right and turned out to be incomplete) and finally pinned
   * down precisely using a real, Playwright-driven browser reproduction
   * (not just console diagnostics): a structural change causes TWO
   * independent things to go wrong at once, not one.
   *
   * 1. Rebuilding the DOM for the changed content removes the
   *    currently-*focused* node from the document, which unconditionally
   *    blurs focus to `<body>`, and neither `focusTextModel` nor
   *    `RangeBinding`'s own reactive sync ever call `.focus()` on
   *    anything to bring it back — they only ever touch the abstract
   *    `Selection`/`Range`. An explicit `std.host.focus({ preventScroll:
   *    true })` is required, and has to run *after* a real native `Range`
   *    already exists in the target block (confirmed live: focusing a
   *    contenteditable region with no `Range` already established inside
   *    it makes the browser synthesize its own, usually empty, selection
   *    as a side effect of the focus change).
   * 2. Establishing that real native `Range` requires the target block's
   *    own DOM component to already be connected and registered in this
   *    nested scope's `ViewStore` (`std.view.getBlock(id)`) — which,
   *    confirmed via the Playwright reproduction, is *not* reliably true
   *    on the very next `requestAnimationFrame` after the structural
   *    change; it can take several frames. Attempting the sync before
   *    that (`RangeManager.textSelectionToRange` returns `null` when it
   *    can't resolve the block) isn't a harmless no-op — `syncTextSelectionToRange`
   *    treats a `null` range as "clear everything," so trying too early
   *    actively destroys whatever range might already exist. This method
   *    polls across frames (bounded, so a block that's genuinely never
   *    coming — e.g. concurrent deletion — can't spin forever) until the
   *    target block is actually there before touching anything.
   *
   * A third, structural issue makes tracking "the std to retry against"
   * by *reference* actively wrong, also only found via the Playwright
   * reproduction: the very same structural edit that requires this
   * reclaim can *also* cause `_maybeRefreshPreview` (invoked from
   * `_subscribeTargetDoc`'s ~100ms debounce) to rebuild the nested
   * `Query`/`Store`/`BlockStdScope` entirely, since the edit's own new
   * block id wasn't in the previous snapshot (see that method's own
   * comment on why the query has to be rebuilt at all). That leaves an
   * in-flight poll holding a reference to an already-superseded
   * `_previewStd`, chasing a block that was never going to appear there
   * — it only ever existed in the *replacement* std. This is why
   * `_pendingFocus` (see its own field comment) is tracked at the
   * component level rather than passed around by std reference: each
   * retry re-reads `this._previewStd` fresh, so a mid-poll std swap is
   * simply picked up rather than orphaning the poll, and a brand-new std
   * — which starts with no `TextSelection` of its own to react to at all
   * — gets one explicitly constructed and applied here rather than
   * waiting for a signal that will never fire on its own.
   *
   * Only reclaims when native DOM focus has *actually* left this scope
   * (`!activeInScope`) — checked via `document.activeElement`, not via
   * this std's own `event.active` flag. Those two can genuinely disagree:
   * confirmed live, via the same Playwright reproduction, that clicking a
   * slash-menu item deactivates this nested scope's own dispatcher
   * (`event.active` flips to `false`) *without* moving
   * `document.activeElement` at all — the slash-menu widget's own DOM
   * renders as a portal outside `<affine-note-ref>` entirely, so a click
   * on one of its items bubbles straight past this component's own
   * `_stopDispatcherActivationBubbling` guard (which only intercepts
   * events that bubble *through* this element) and reactivates the
   * *outer* page's dispatcher via `UIEventDispatcher`'s single
   * app-wide-mutual-exclusion `_activeDispatcher`, deactivating this one
   * as a side effect — while the click handler itself (by design, a
   * standard toolbar/menu UX pattern) never actually steals DOM focus
   * away from the editor at all. Gating on `event.active` here treated
   * that entirely legitimate, transient deactivation as "focus was
   * destroyed by a DOM rebuild," and forcibly reapplied a *stale*
   * `_pendingFocus` selection — confirmed live: this raced directly
   * against the slash-menu's own `_handleClickItem` (which first cleans
   * the "/query" text, *then* asynchronously runs `item.action`), landing
   * in the middle of that sequence and corrupting the selection state the
   * action's own command chain (e.g. `getSelectedModelsCommand`) needed,
   * which is why slash-menu items silently inserted nothing. An ordinary
   * keystroke while genuinely focused also fires the selection-changed
   * signal this is triggered from and must be a no-op; re-focusing
   * unconditionally on every keystroke would fight the user's own native
   * caret position (e.g. arrow-key movement) on every single one — but
   * that's already covered by checking real DOM focus, since an ordinary
   * keystroke never moves `document.activeElement` away in the first
   * place.

   * "true"])')`. For the *outer* std that's scoped to the whole page; for
   * the *nested* std it's scoped to just this reference's own content —
   * but it's the exact same DOM elements underneath either way, and the
   * exclusion attribute is a single, shared, boolean DOM attribute with
   * no concept of "which std is asking." A permanent exclusion doesn't
   * just protect the outer std's own sweeps from reaching in — it also
   * permanently blinds the *nested* std's own, entirely legitimate
   * internal queries to its own content, breaking every command that
   * needs to resolve "what block is the current (nested) selection on."
   *
   * Fixed by making this conditional, mirroring the same-doc path's own
   * `_updateRangeQueryExclusion` (which already gets this right for that
   * case) but with the boundary check flipped: exclusion should apply
   * only when the *outer* std's own current selection genuinely spans
   * across this reference's boundary (touches some block id inside this
   * reference *and* some block id outside it in the same selection) — the
   * one case a sweep-based delete could actually reach in and corrupt
   * canonical content. Whenever the outer selection is empty (the normal
   * state while the user is actively working *inside* the reference,
   * since the outer std has no reason to hold a selection then) or
   * entirely outside this reference (ordinary editing elsewhere on the
   * page), there is no cross-boundary risk to guard against, so exclusion
   * is lifted — which is exactly when the nested std's own internal
   * queries need it lifted to function at all.
