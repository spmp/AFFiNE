/**
 * A near-copy of `PreviewRootBlockComponent` ('preview-page''s `affine:page`
 * view), minus its one hardcoded behavior that doesn't work for this use
 * case: it unconditionally skips any note whose `displayMode` is
 * `EdgelessOnly` — which is exactly the displayMode every `note-ref`
 * canonical Note uses (`createReusableNoteAndInsertRefCommand`), so it's
 * invisible in the *real* page (via the identical exclusion in
 * `page-root-block.ts`). Reusing `preview-page` as-is would silently hide
 * the very thing this is meant to render.
 *
 * Only needed for a *cross-doc* reference (Story 0.5) — a same-doc
 * reference renders directly through the outer host's own already-active
 * `affine:page` view (see `note-ref-block.ts`'s same-doc path), never
 * mounting a nested scope of its own at all. Mirrors `database-ref`'s own
 * `DatabaseRefPreviewRootOverride` exactly, including the two wrong turns
 * that override's own doc comment records (`preview-edgeless`'s
 * `pointer-events: none`/viewport-lock baggage) — not re-litigated here,
 * same conclusion applies for the same reasons.
