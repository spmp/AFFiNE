/**
 * Every `Store` (including a query-filtered preview one) builds its own

 * (`Block`/`SyncController`, `framework/store/src/model/block/*.ts`), even
 * when another `Store` already has its own independent graph for those
 * *same* underlying Yjs blocks. `Store.dispose()` exists specifically to
 * tear this down (`store.ts:1242`, unobserves the doc). We never called it:
 * when `_maybeRefreshPreview` below replaces `_previewStore` with a new one
 * (the ancestor chain changed), the old one — and its entire graph of
 * per-block Yjs observers — was simply abandoned, left running forever,
 * continuing to react to every future change to those blocks even though
 * nothing renders through it anymore. Left unbounded, this accumulates
 * extra live reactive graphs racing the *current* one against the same
 * underlying data — exactly the shape of thing that can trip signals'
 * own re-entrancy guard ("Cycle detected") under rapid successive writes
 * (e.g. dragging Kanban cards) — worst right after a reload, when a burst
 * of incoming Yjs updates as the whole doc syncs in is most likely to
 * shift the ancestor chain (rebuilding the store) more than once in quick
 * succession, across several references at once.
 *
 * Since every reference to the same canonical table shares one
 * `_previewStore` instance (see the module comment below), we can't just
 * dispose it when any single reference stops using it — this reference-
 * counts instead, keyed by object identity, and only disposes (and evicts
 * the doc's own `getStore({query})` cache entry, so a future reference
 * doesn't get handed back an already-disposed store) once nothing is
 * using it anymore.

/**
 * Renders a live view of a single `affine:database` block, addressed by
 * `refBlockId` (currently same-doc only; `refDocId` defaults to the current
 * doc — cross-doc addressing is a planned follow-on once this is solid).
 *
 * Unlike `affine:surface-ref` (which crops an edgeless viewport around a
 * Gfx element's `xywh` bound), a database block is flow content with no
 * `xywh` — so this mounts a nested `BlockStdScope` over a *filtered* view of
 * the doc (via `Query`, `mode: 'include'`) that displays only the database
 * block's own ancestor chain plus its descendant rows.
 *
 * The filtered `Store` is *not* opened read-only: `DatabaseBlockDataSource`
 * (constructed internally by the registered `affine-database` component
 * when it renders inside this nested scope) reads/writes via
 * `this._model.store`, which — because BlockSuite `Store`s over the same
 * `Doc` share live Yjs data — resolves to the *actual* target store. Row
 * add/edit/delete performed inside this rendered view lands on the real
 * source rows, and every other reference to the same `refBlockId` sees it
 * live too.
 *
 * VIEW SPEC — went through two wrong turns before landing here, both found
 * only through hands-on testing, not automated tests:
 *  1. Tried 'preview-page' first: its root (`PreviewRootBlockComponent`)
 *     hardcodes an exclusion for any note whose `displayMode` is
 *     `EdgelessOnly` — exactly the mode the hidden host note this relies on
 *     uses (see `commands.ts`), so it never rendered at all.
 *  2. Switched to 'preview-edgeless' to dodge that filter (its root has
 *     none) — but that root sets `pointer-events: none` and pairs with
 *     `EdgelessLocker` (`viewport.locked = true`): correct for a genuine
 *     read-only preview, but it made the rendered table uneditable and its
 *     own menus unclickable, and its `height: 100%` styling collapsed to
 *     zero outside a real full-height viewport container.
 *  3. Landed here: still 'preview-page' (fully interactive, sizes to
 *     content naturally, no viewport/height fuss), but with its `affine:page`
 *     view registration overridden (`DatabaseRefPreviewRootOverride`,
 *     appended after the rest of 'preview-page's extensions so it wins) to a
 *     near-identical root with just the `EdgelessOnly` exclusion removed.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE (learned the hard way in an earlier pass at this): `BlockStdScope`'s
 * constructor is expensive — it wires up 13+ internal subsystems
 * (CommandManager, GfxController, ViewManager, etc.) plus the entire
 * `preview-page` view spec, roughly the cost of mounting a whole editor.
 * Two things are required to avoid rebuilding it on every keystroke:
 *  1. `guard(this._previewStore, ...)` in `render()`, so a `BlockStdScope`
 *     is only (re)constructed when `_previewStore`'s reference changes.
 *  2. `_previewStore` itself must not get a new reference on every doc
 *     update — `_maybeRefreshPreview` below only replaces it when the
 *     referenced block's ancestor chain (the only thing the `Query` actually
 *     depends on) has structurally changed, not on routine content edits.
 * Without both together, `guard()` alone doesn't help, since it would still
 * see a "changed" dependency on every update.

   * entirely inside the view's own render, driven by that component's own
   * private `virtualPadding$` signal, which nothing an ancestor does can
   * influence. `database-override.ts` disables that component's own
   * (broken-for-nested-rendering) measurement instead, and this method
   * drives its `virtualPadding$` directly.
   *
   * Measures from `nestedDatabase`'s *own* rect, not this wrapper's: an
   * earlier version measured `this.getBoundingClientRect()` (the outer
   * `affine-database-ref` wrapper) instead, reasoning that this wrapper
   * sits exactly where the nested database renders — but the nested
   * `BlockStdScope`'s own note/page chrome inserts a small additional
   * offset between the wrapper and the actual nested element, so that
   * measurement systematically overshot the real value by a roughly
   * constant amount (confirmed live: every reference on a page reported
   * the same, uniformly-too-high padding value regardless of its own
   * position, and manually forcing a smaller value fixed the visible
   * clipping — a fixed offset error, not a reactivity failure).
   *
   * Uses `autoUpdate` from `@floating-ui/dom` — the same helper
   * `database-block.ts`'s own `listenFullWidthChange()` uses — rather than
   * a plain `ResizeObserver`, since the latter only fires on *size*
   * changes, not *position* changes, and left a stale, wrong measurement
   * uncorrected for a reference whose own size never changed after an
   * early, pre-layout-settling measurement (confirmed live).
