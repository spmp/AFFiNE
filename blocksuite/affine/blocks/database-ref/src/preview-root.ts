/**
 * A near-copy of `PreviewRootBlockComponent` ('preview-page''s `affine:page`
 * view), minus its one hardcoded behavior that doesn't work for this use
 * case: it unconditionally skips any note whose `displayMode` is
 * `EdgelessOnly` (see `preview-root-block.ts`) — which is exactly the
 * displayMode the hidden host note this package relies on uses (see
 * `commands.ts`), specifically so it's invisible in the *real* page (which
 * goes through the same exclusion in `page-root-block.ts`). Reusing
 * `preview-page` as-is would silently hide the very thing this is meant to
 * render.
 *
 * `preview-edgeless` was tried first as a way around that (its root has no
 * such filter), but it turned out to carry its own baggage found only
 * through hands-on testing: `EdgelessRootPreviewBlockComponent` sets
 * `pointer-events: none` and pairs with `EdgelessLocker`
 * (`viewport.locked = true`) — both are correct for a genuine read-only
 * preview, but make the rendered database uneditable and its own menus
 * unclickable, and its `height: 100%` styling collapses to zero outside a
 * real full-height viewport container (a second, unrelated bug this
 * disagreement caused). Page-mode content sizes to its own content
 * naturally and has neither problem, so this custom root — registered
 * *after* the rest of `preview-page`'s extensions in `database-ref-block.ts`
 * so it wins the `affine:page` slot — is the actual fix: same interactive,
 * normally-sized rendering as any other page content, with only the one
 * exclusion removed.
