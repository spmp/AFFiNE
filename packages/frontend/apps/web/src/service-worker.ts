// the lazy-loading these chunks exist for) but are worth caching once
// actually requested, so a feature the user has already visited keeps
// working offline on a later visit. Content-hashed filenames make them safe
// to cache-first indefinitely. Originally scoped to just the drawio
// `library-stencils-*` chunks; broadened to any /js/*.js chunk after
// finding a numbered route/feature chunk failed outright offline; broadened
// again to match by extension alone, not by path prefix, after finding a
// lazy *.css chunk (npm-async-@vanilla-extract...) fails the exact same way
// — it isn't under /js/ at all, it's emitted at the root, so the /js/-
// scoped pattern never matched it.
//
// No `*.worker.js` exclusion (there was one; removed): every worker except
// nbstore.worker.js is small (under 200KB) and completely harmless to
// cache. nbstore.worker.js is ~50MB and *is* a real risk against iOS's
// documented ~50MB Cache Storage soft cap — but it's also the actual engine
// that reads local IndexedDB documents, so excluding it meant offline mode
// could render the app shell but never any real content, defeating this
// story's entire purpose. Caching it is opportunistic (only after a real
// online visit already downloaded it once), not eager precache, so this is
// a considered tradeoff, not an oversight — AC-5's real-hardware testing is
// where this actually gets validated, not guessed at here.
